## Brief
These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2022. Most solutions are in Python, but some are in Java.

## How to compile my code
All commands will involve the `run.py` file.

**Run today's solutions:**
This will run both solutions for the current day in the current year.

    python3 run.py
**Run a specific solution from today:**

    python3 run.py [A or B]
**Run solutions from different days:**

    python3 run.py [day]
   
**Run a specific solution from a different day:**

    python3 run.py [day] [A or B]
    
## Create file
All commands will involve the `utils.py` file.

**Create a file for today:**

    python3 utils.py new
**Create a file for any day:**

    python3 utils.py new [day]
    
## Push code to GitHub
All commands will again use the `utils.py` file.

**Push today's code:**

    python3 utils.py push
**Push a different day's code:**

    python3 utils.py push [day]
